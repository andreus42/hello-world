# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. Awesome!!!

My name is Andrew. I'm interested in big ideas and solving even bigger problems. As a Quality visionary, big-data disciple, team-building champion, exercise enthusiast, and nemesis to big beer, I use my scientific background and a data-driven approach to solving problems in both my professional and personal life.

My academic and industry experience includes extensive experience in designing and executing experiments. At Keene State College, my lab developed novel inorganic carbene molecules, which required working in an air-sensitive environment. As a process chemist at Len-Tex Corporation, I performed two-level factorial design in the development of higher performing, and more sustainable inks, topcoats, and adhesives, and helped the organization achieve Cradle-to-Cradle certification through the MBDC.

I currently work at Chroma Technology, an optical filter company, that supplies optics to the life sciences, astronomy, and machine vision industries. Some of the super-resolution applications we support are TIRF, STED, PALM, STORM, which represent the bleeding edge of biological research, and resolve images as small the nano level. At Chroma we take pride in being a 100% employee-owned business where we not only share in the profits but encourage participation of employees to think as employee-owners, to development, and act as good neighbors to our local community through volunteer service and financial support.
